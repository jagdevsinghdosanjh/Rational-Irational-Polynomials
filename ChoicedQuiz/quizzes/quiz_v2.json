    "question": "Which is a polynomial?",
    "options": ["x^2 + 3", "√x + 1", "1/x", "x⁻¹ + 2"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Only x² + 3 follows the definition of a polynomial, which requires non-negative integer exponents."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the degree of the polynomial 4x³ + 3x² - x + 7?",
    "options": ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable. Here, it's 3."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a linear polynomial?",
    "options": ["x² + 2x + 1", "3x + 5", "x³ - x", "5"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A linear polynomial has degree 1. 3x + 5 fits this definition."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the coefficient of x² in the polynomial 5x² - 3x + 2?",
    "options": ["5", "-3", "2", "0"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The coefficient of x² is the number multiplied by x², which is 5."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is not a polynomial?",
    "options": ["x² + 1", "x⁻² + 3", "2x + 5", "x³ - 4x"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "x⁻² + 3 is not a polynomial because it contains a negative exponent."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the constant term in the polynomial 7x² - 4x + 9?",
    "options": ["7", "-4", "9", "0"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The constant term is the term without any variable, which is 9."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a quadratic polynomial?",
    "options": ["x + 1", "x² + 2x + 1", "x³ - 3", "5"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A quadratic polynomial has degree 2. x² + 2x + 1 is quadratic."
