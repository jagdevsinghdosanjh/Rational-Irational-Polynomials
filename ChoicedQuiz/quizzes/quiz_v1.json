    "question": "Which of the following is a rational number?",
    "options": ["√2", "π", "3/4", "e"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "3/4 is a rational number as it can be expressed as a ratio of two integers."
  },

    "question": "What is the decimal representation of 1/3?",
    "options": ["0.333...", "0.3", "0.3333", "0.33333..."],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "1/3 = 0.333... (a non-terminating, repeating decimal)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is an irrational number?",
    "options": ["0.1010010001...", "√4", "7/8", "0.25"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "This is a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal and hence irrational."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the value of √49?",
    "options": ["6", "7", "8", "9"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "√49 = 7 since 7² = 49."

    "question": "Which of the following is a terminating decimal?",
    "options": ["1/3", "1/2", "1/7", "1/9"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "1/2 = 0.5, which terminates."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the decimal expansion of 7/8?",
    "options": ["0.875", "0.87", "0.888...", "0.8"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "7 divided by 8 equals 0.875."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a perfect square?",
    "options": ["50", "64", "72", "90"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "64 = 8², hence it's a perfect square."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the approximate value of √2?",
    "options": ["1.414", "1.5", "1.3", "1.6"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "√2 ≈ 1.414."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a non-terminating, repeating decimal?",
    "options": ["0.333...", "0.25", "0.1010010001...", "0.5"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "0.333... has a repeating 3, so it's repeating but non-terminating."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the cube root of 27?",
    "options": ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "³√27 = 3 because 3³ = 27."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of these is a rational number?",
    "options": ["√3", "π", "5/6", "e"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "5/6 is a ratio of integers, so it's rational."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the decimal representation of 1/8?",
    "options": ["0.125", "0.12", "0.1", "0.15"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "1 ÷ 8 = 0.125, a terminating decimal."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a surd?",
    "options": ["√4", "√5", "2", "3"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "√5 is irrational and not a perfect square — it's a surd."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the value of √81?",
    "options": ["8", "9", "10", "11"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "√81 = 9 since 9² = 81."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal?",
    "options": ["π", "0.5", "0.333...", "1/4"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "π is a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal, hence irrational."
